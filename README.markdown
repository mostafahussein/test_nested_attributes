# test_nested_attributes

I haven't done nested attributes in Rails 4, and I hear a lot of folks
having issues with them, so I thought I'd put up a little experimental
application to try it out.

## Models

- *Recipes* - to make something
- *Ingredients* - things that go into recipes
- *Directions* - steps to make the recipe

## Results

Just following the guides, I put this together in about an hour.
